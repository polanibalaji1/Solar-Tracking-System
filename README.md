# Solar-Tracking-System
Energy crisis is the most important issue in todayâ€™s world. Currently, renewable energy solutions are becoming increasingly popular. The idea of converting solar energy into electrical energy using photovoltaic panels holds its place in the front row compared to other renewable sources. Currently, most solar panels are fixed and static position. The solar panel has a fixed orientation to the sky and does not turn to follow the sun. This may contribute that the energy captured is not always maximized because of the static placement of the panel limits their area of exposure from the sun. The efficiency with solar tracking methodology is higher than that with fixed angle. The oriented solar panels in the way of sun tracking would lead to the maximum power and increase the output.  Light dependent resistors are used as the sensors of the solar tracker and to rotate the panels we use the Servo mortors. So that we can capture the solar energy by producing more energy.
